Welcome to a repository hosting code for a simulation study and example analysis that examines bias and 
confidence interval coverage of abundance estimators when density surface models (DSMs; sensu Miller et al. 2013)
are fitted to animal transect data.  In particular, we examine the case where detection and density processes 
are correlated in space.

This code is associated with the paper, "Correlation between density and detection processes induces bias in spatial models of animal abundance"
by P.B. Conn and M.C. Ferguson (to be submitted to Environmetrics).

The simulation study can be replicated via the R script, /inst/sim_study.R
The beluga analysis can be replicated via the R script /inst/xy_tw_DSM_2022.R
